# TypeScript React Playground

This repository serves as a TypeScript playground for React, providing a simple application to help developers grasp the fundamental concepts of TypeScript in React.js applications.

## Key Features
- **Type Annotations**: Demonstrates the use of type annotations to define variable and function types.
- **Props and State**: Illustrates how to type-check props and state objects.
- **Function Components**: Shows how to create function components with TypeScript.
- **Hooks**: Utilizes TypeScript with React hooks like useState and useEffect.
- **Custom Components**: Highlights type definitions for custom components.
- **Type Inference**: Explores TypeScript's type inference capabilities for enhanced code safety.

## Getting Started
To explore TypeScript in React and run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the application using `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Customization
Feel free to customize and extend this application to further experiment with TypeScript and React:

- Add new components and props to practice type annotations.
- Implement state management using useState with type definitions.
- Explore TypeScript interfaces and types for complex data structures.

## Technologies Used
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- [Create React App with TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/): Guidance on setting up TypeScript in a React application.
